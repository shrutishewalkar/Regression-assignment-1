    "Regularization is a technique used in logistic regression to prevent overfitting, which occurs when the model becomes too complex and fits the training data too closely, resulting in poor performance on new, unseen data. Regularization works by adding a penalty term to the cost function, which discourages the model from assigning large weights to any one feature, thus reducing overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In logistic regression, the penalty term is often expressed as the L1 or L2 norm of the weight vector. L1 regularization, also known as Lasso regularization, adds the sum of the absolute values of the weights to the cost function. L2 regularization, also known as Ridge regularization, adds the sum of the squared values of the weights to the cost function. These penalty terms are multiplied by a regularization parameter lambda, which controls the strength of the regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The effect of regularization is to shrink the weights towards zero, thereby reducing the impact of any one feature on the prediction. This can help prevent overfitting, as the model will be less sensitive to noise or irrelevant features in the data. Regularization can also help with feature selection, as it tends to push the weights of irrelevant features towards zero."

    "Univariate Feature Selection: This technique involves selecting features based on their individual performance in predicting the target variable. The most common method is to use statistical tests such as chi-squared or ANOVA to evaluate the relationship between each feature and the target variable. Features with low p-values are considered significant and are included in the model. The advantage of this technique is its simplicity, but it may not capture interactions between features.\n",

    "\n",
    "Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE): RFE is an iterative method that starts with all features and removes the least important feature in each iteration until the desired number of features is reached. The importance of each feature is measured by the decrease in the model's performance when the feature is removed. The advantage of this technique is that it considers the interaction between features and can select a subset of features that performs better than using all features.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Regularization: Regularization is a method of adding a penalty term to the cost function that reduces the magnitude of the coefficients, leading to feature selection. L1 regularization (Lasso) tends to produce sparse solutions with some coefficients set to zero, while L2 regularization (Ridge) shrinks all coefficients towards zero. The advantage of regularization is that it reduces overfitting and can improve the model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Principal Component Analysis (PCA): PCA is a technique for reducing the dimensionality of the feature space by finding a smaller set of uncorrelated variables that explain most of the variance in the data. The advantage of PCA is that it can reduce the complexity of the model and improve its interpretability."

Oversampling can be achieved by duplicating the minority class samples, or by generating synthetic samples using techniques such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).

Another approach is to use dimensionality reduction techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the number of independent variables.\n",

Cross-validation can also be used to tune model parameters and select the best model.\n",
